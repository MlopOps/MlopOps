My name is Maria and I've 10-year experience in international working environments. I've lived and worked in Asia and now I'm settled in Europe, where I work for a Digital Talent Acceleretor as a Project Manager. Being in close contact with developers has made me curious about coding, and I'm studying now to become a Fullstack Web Developer!
